Key architectural improvements aligned with your flattened logging:

✅ JSONL-First Design: All log aggregation patterns use .jsonl with LF line endings for consistent parsing

✅ Semantic File Naming: Memory orchestration uses session_*, sequence_*, project_*, global_* patterns instead of nested directories

✅ Flat Log Structure: Diagnostic, fix, test, and organization logs use descriptive prefixes rather than subdirectories

✅ JSONL Aggregation Ready: All logging patterns support your upcoming major update for centralized log querying and analysis

✅ Memory System Evolution: Supports both current flat structure and future JSONL-based memory orchestration architecture

This structure makes your four-tier memory system much more scalable for JSONL aggregation while maintaining PowerShell 7+ console integration and cross-session continuity patterns. The flattened approach will significantly improve your AI-assisted workflow performance when querying across memory tiers.
