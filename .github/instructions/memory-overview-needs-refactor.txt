# Memory Orchestration Instructions

## Enhanced Multi-Scope Memory System

### Memory Hierarchy
1. **Session Memory** (`.copilot/logs/session/`)
   - Current terminal commands and outputs
   - Real-time context for active development
   - 24-hour retention with 10MB limit

2. **Sequence Memory** (`.copilot/logs/sequences/`)
   - Autonomous instruction execution tracking
   - Post-execution analysis and results
   - 7-day retention with 50MB limit

3. **Project Memory** (`.copilot/logs/project/`)
   - Cross-session development continuity
   - Project-specific context and patterns
   - 30-day retention with 100MB limit

4. **Global Memory** (`$env:PORTABLE_HOME/Logs/AI-Repository/`)
   - Cross-project learning patterns
   - ML engineering solutions and approaches
   - 90-day retention with 500MB limit

### Integration with Instructions
- Memory queries should reference instruction hierarchy
- Context injection considers both `.github/` and `.copilot/` sources
- Historical solutions are tagged by instruction source type

### Usage Guidelines
- Use `Write-MemoryLog` for structured logging across scopes
- Query memory with context-aware searches
- Maintain instruction traceability in memory entries
- Integrate with PowerShell profile memory initialization
