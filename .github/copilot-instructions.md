# Adaptive Bayesian Driver - Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
This is a demo for Helm.ai Research Engineer interviews, bridging LC-NE neuroscience research to computer vision for autonomous driving.

## Technical Stack
- PyTorch 2.4.0 with Intel 8-core optimization
- Uncertainty quantification (UNIQUE, NIST ml-uncertainty-py, torch-uncertainty)
- Geometric deep learning (geomstats, umap-learn)
- Biological systems inspiration from LC-NE dual-timescale dynamics

## Code Standards
- Use biological systems terminology in comments and documentation
- Emphasize uncertainty quantification and Bayesian approaches
- Optimize for Intel 8-core + 32GB RAM system
- Connect implementations to neuroscience principles where applicable

## Architecture Patterns
- Implement uncertainty-aware neural networks with Monte Carlo dropout
- Use geometric priors in latent space representations
- Apply dual-timescale uncertainty modeling from LC-NE research
- Focus on safety-critical applications for autonomous driving

## Phase Strategy
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: MNIST uncertainty demo (current implementation)
- üîÆ Phase 2: CARLA integration (designed placeholders)
- üè≠ Phase 3: Production deployment (strategic planning)
