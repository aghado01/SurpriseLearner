# Repository Cleanup Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the repository cleanup changes implemented according to the `repo-cleanup-part1.txt` instructions.

## âœ… Completed Changes

### 1. Configuration Files
- **`.env`**: Updated with Python 3.11 configuration, CUDA settings, and project-specific variables
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Modernized with Python 3.11, updated dependencies, and Ruff/mypy configuration
- **`requirements.txt`**: Streamlined for interview-ready MNIST demo with CUDA-first PyTorch
- **`requirements-aspirational.txt`**: Created for Helm-aligned production stack with MLOps tools

### 2. Development Tooling
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Comprehensive hooks including security scanning, Ruff formatting, and type checking
- **`setup.py`**: Simplified for modern pyproject.toml-based configuration
- **`setup.cfg`**: Updated metadata and tool configurations

### 3. Containerization
- **`Dockerfile`**: Multi-stage build optimized for development and demonstration
- **`.dockerignore`**: Comprehensive exclusion patterns for clean builds

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**: Complete pipeline with linting, testing, and Docker builds
- Includes code quality checks, test coverage, and package verification

### 5. Package Structure
- **`adaptive_bayesian_driver/`**: Proper Python package structure created
  - `__init__.py`: Core imports with CUDA detection and error handling
  - `config.py`: YAML configuration management with device detection
  - `utils/device.py`: Device management utilities
  - Moved existing `models/`, `environment/`, `utils/` from `src/`

### 6. Demo and Testing
- **`demo.py`**: Functional demonstration script with comprehensive testing
- Package import verification and device detection testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

### Professional Engineering Practices
- Modern Python 3.11 packaging with pyproject.toml
- Pre-commit hooks for automated code quality
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline

- Device detection and fallback mechanisms
- GPU-optimized configuration settings

### Helm.ai Alignment
- MLOps-ready aspirational dependencies (MLflow, Wandb, Hydra)
- FastAPI/ONNX for production deployment readiness
- Scalable architecture foundations

### GRRI Methodology Integration
- Systematic AI-assisted workflow structure
- Strategic commenting for advanced capabilities signaling
- Interview-focused scope with professional depth

## ðŸ“‹ Installation Instructions

```bash
# 1. Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Install package in development mode
pip install -e .

# 3. Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# 4. Verify installation
python demo.py

# 5. Test CUDA (if available)
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```
