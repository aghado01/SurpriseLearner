Adaptive Bayesian Driver: Bridging Neuroscience and Computer Vision
Project Overview
Adaptive Bayesian Driver is a demonstration project that bridges biological uncertainty modeling principles from neuroscience to computer vision applications in autonomous driving. This work translates dual-timescale uncertainty encoding from the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system into geometric priors for neural network perception, directly connecting to Helm.ai's Deep Teaching methodology.

Core Innovation: From Biological Vision to Artificial Perception
This project demonstrates how biological uncertainty processing can inform artificial vision systems through:

Dual-Timescale Uncertainty Modeling
Based on my COSYNE 2014 research, this implementation captures uncertainty at two distinct temporal scales:

Within-trial uncertainty: Real-time confidence in individual predictions

Across-trial uncertainty: Contextual adaptation based on environmental volatility

Geometric Priors in Latent Space
Moving beyond traditional classification, we implement:

Uncertainty-aware latent representations that encode geometric structure

Bayesian neural layers for principled uncertainty quantification

Adaptive learning dynamics modulated by confidence estimates
