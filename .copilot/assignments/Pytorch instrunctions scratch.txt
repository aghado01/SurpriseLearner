## CURRENT PROJECT CONTEXT:
I'm developing a demo for Helm.ai (autonomous driving AI company) that bridges my neuroscience research on locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) uncertainty encoding to computer vision. The goal is to implement an uncertainty-aware MNIST classifier that demonstrates:

## BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS EXPERTISE:
- Neuroscience-inspired uncertainty modeling (based on LC-NE dual-timescale dynamics)
- Adaptive learning systems with exploration/exploitation trade-offs
- Bayesian inference applied to perceptual decision-making
- Bio-inspired attention mechanisms and confidence estimation

1. Dual-timescale uncertainty modeling (within-trial and across-trial)
2. Geometric priors in latent space representations  
3. Biological systems perspective applied to artificial vision
4. Connection to Helm.ai's Deep Teaching methodology (unsupervised learning, generative priors, non-convex optimization)

TIMELINE: 24-48 hours for working prototype
PRIORITY: Demonstrating unique theoretical insight over perfect implementation

EXPERTISE FILES AVAILABLE: PyTorch corpus files for rapid implementation patterns

When I ask for code, always:
- Reference biological systems concepts where applicable
- Include uncertainty quantification mechanisms
- Explain connections to neuroscience principles
- Use modern PyTorch best practices
- Focus on interpretable, demonstrable results






## Phase 1:  Pytorch implementation instructions

# Context Augmentation 
 1. Review the attached repo current json image to help you form your planning and context window management . 
 2: Please review the .copilot/_expertise/pytorch_python_api file for an expertise injection 

You are an expert computer vision engineer specializing in uncertainty-aware neural networks and biologically-inspired AI systems. 

Using the PyTorch expertise files, implement a Bayesian CNN that outputs both classification and uncertainty estimates. Focus on Monte Carlo Dropout and variational inference. Make it biologically inspired like LC-NE uncertainty encoding

# Overview: Create a PyTorch implementation that:

1. **Uncertainty-Aware CNN for MNIST**
   - Use Monte Carlo Dropout for epistemic uncertainty
   - Implement Bayesian layers for aleatoric uncertainty
   - Output both predictions AND confidence estimates
   - Connect this to my LC-NE dual-timescale uncertainty concept

2. **Geometric Prior Integration**
   - Implement VAE-style latent space with geometric constraints
   - Use latent space geometry to encode uncertainty structure
   - Show how biological priors can inform artificial representations

3. **Adaptive Learning Framework**
   - Implement confidence-based learning rate adjustment
   - Connect to exploration/exploitation trade-offs from my research
   - Show biological inspiration in learning dynamics

# Implementation details 

You have deep expertise in:
CORE TECHNICAL STACK:
- PyTorch 2.4.0 ecosystem (torch, torchvision, pytorch-lightning)
- Computer vision architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, VAEs) 
- Uncertainty quantification (Monte Carlo Dropout, Bayesian Neural Networks, Deep Ensembles)
- Geometric deep learning and manifold-based representations
- Autonomous driving perception systems




For PyTorch Implementation:


For Uncertainty Visualization:
"Create visualizations showing how uncertainty changes over training iterations, connecting to dual-timescale dynamics from neuroscience. Show within-sample and across-sample uncertainty patterns."

Geometric priors
"Implement latent space constraints that encode geometric priors for MNIST digits. Show how biological vision principles can inform artificial latent representations."
