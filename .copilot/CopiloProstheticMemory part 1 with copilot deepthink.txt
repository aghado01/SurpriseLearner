I also want to use JSONL store for my coding agent memory augmentation sysystem based on hierarchical logging, some helpers like session boundary detection, etc. Instead of writing to files and folders, to a single source of truth
Copilot said
JSONL Memory Augmentation Architecture
Building a single source of truth for your coding agent’s memory involves treating each interaction, event, and context update as a structured JSON record. By streaming these records into a newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) store, you gain append-only auditability, hierarchical logging, and pluggable session helpers without scattering data across files and folders.

Core Concepts
Each log entry is an atomic JSON object with a consistent schema

Entries are appended in real time into a single JSONL file or stream

Session boundaries, hierarchical context, and metadata pointers live inside each entry

A lightweight index or in-memory buffer can speed up reads by session, by project, or globally

Schema Design
Define a unified JSON schema that covers all your capture, memory, and augmentation layers:

json

Copy
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T16:30:12.345Z",
  "session_id": "sess-42a8b",
  "event_type": "command" | "file_change" | "augmentation",
  "hierarchy": {
    "project_id": "proj-xyz",
    "sequence": 17,
    "parent_sequence": 16
  },
  "payload": {
    "command": "git status",
    "file": "src/main.ps1",
    "diff": "...",
    "injected_memory": ["ctx-123", "ctx-124"]
  },
  "helpers": {
    "session_boundary": "start" | "continue" | "end",
    "context_hooks": ["pre-run", "post-run"],
    "instruction_template_id": "tmpl-auth-1"
  }
}
timestamp records exact ordering

session_id groups related events

hierarchy allows nested contexts and cross-session references

helpers contains flags for boundary detection and hooks

Session Boundary Detection
Use a helper module that emits special markers:

Emit a “start” marker on first user interaction or workspace open

Mark “continue” for every subsequent event within idle time threshold

Detect “end” after a configurable period of inactivity, explicit user exit, or environment shutdown

These markers live in the helpers.session_boundary field so readers can segment the JSONL stream:

json

Copy
{"timestamp": "...", "session_id":"sess-42a8b", "event_type":"meta", "helpers":{"session_boundary":"start"}}
Hierarchical Logging Integration
Wire your existing hierarchical logger so each log call translates into a JSONL line:

Wrap or extend your logger (PowerShell, .NET, Python) to serialize structured events

Tag each log entry with hierarchy.project_id, hierarchy.sequence and parent pointers

Append directly to the JSONL sink (file, STDOUT, or a streaming endpoint)

This preserves context chains and makes it trivial to reconstruct multi-step operations.

Data Flow
text

Copy
[Capture Layer] → [JSONL Sink] → [Memory Layer] → [Augmentation Layer]
Capture hooks intercept commands, file watcher events, and console output

Events serialize immediately into the JSONL sink

Memory layer processes the JSONL stream to build context graphs, vector embeddings, or key KV pairs

Augmentation layer queries the JSONL store for dynamic injections

Query and Augmentation
To augment a new prompt:

Identify current session_id and hierarchy scope

Scan JSONL for entries matching session or project constraints

Synthesize context via your Context Synthesis Engine

Inject top-K relevant payload segments into the prompt

Consider maintaining a lightweight in-memory index of recent entries to avoid rescanning the entire file.

Example Implementation Snippet (Python)
python

Copy
import json, time, uuid

class JsonlMemoryStore:
    def __init__(self, path):
        self.path = path
        self.session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.sequence = 0

    def log_event(self, event_type, payload, helper_flags):
        entry = {
            "timestamp": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ", time.gmtime()),
            "session_id": self.session_id,
            "event_type": event_type,
            "hierarchy": {
                "project_id": helper_flags.get("project_id"),
                "sequence": self.sequence,
                "parent_sequence": helper_flags.get("parent_sequence")
            },
            "payload": payload,
            "helpers": helper_flags
        }
        with open(self.path, "a") as f:
            f.write(json.dumps(entry) + "\n")
        self.sequence += 1

# usage
store = JsonlMemoryStore("agent_memory.jsonl")
store.log_event(
    "command",
    {"command": "dotnet build"},
    {"session_boundary": "continue", "project_id": "proj-xyz"}
)
Next Steps and Extensions
build a small vector index on top of JSONL payloads for semantic retrieval

expose a gRPC or REST API to stream and query events in real time

layer a validation schema (JSON Schema or Protobuf) for stronger typing

integrate memory pruning based on token budgets and registry-driven rules

visualize session timelines and context graphs with simple D3 or Graphviz exports

This JSONL approach keeps your augmentation system modular, introspective, and reproducible, all anchored on a single, auditable source of truth.

This is what i've got so far in terms of the behavioral machinery and such
Copilot said
Consolidating Hierarchical Logs into a JSONL Memory Store
You’ve built an impressive set of PowerShell modules for capture, supervision, templating, etc. The next step is to route all of those multi-scope events into a single newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) sink. This gives you:

One append-only, audit-friendly source of truth

Unified schema for session, sequence, project, global events

Easy ingestion by your augmentation layer or vector index

1. JSONL Memory Store Module
Create a new file Core/JsonlMemoryStore.ps1 with a class to drive all logging:

powershell

Copy
class JsonlMemoryStore {
    [string]$Path
    [string]$SessionId
    [int]$Sequence

    JsonlMemoryStore([string]$path) {
        $this.Path       = $path
        $this.SessionId  = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString()
        $this.Sequence   = 0
    }

    [void]LogEvent(
        [string]$EventType,
        [hashtable]$Payload,
        [hashtable]$Helpers
    ) {
        $entry = @{
            timestamp   = (Get-Date).ToString("o")
            session_id  = $this.SessionId
            sequence    = $this.Sequence
            event_type  = $EventType
            payload     = $Payload
            helpers     = $Helpers
        } | ConvertTo-Json -Compress

        Add-Content -Path $this.Path -Value $entry
        $this.Sequence++
    }

    [void]StartSession() {
        $this.LogEvent(
            "session_boundary",
            @{ status = "start" },
            @{ idle_timeout = 900 }
        )
    }

    [void]EndSession() {
        $this.LogEvent(
            "session_boundary",
            @{ status = "end" },
            @{}
        )
    }
}

# Initialize global store
$global:MemStore = [JsonlMemoryStore]::new("$env:PORTABLE_HOME\agent_memory.jsonl")
$global:MemStore.StartSession()
LogEvent appends a single JSON object per line

StartSession/EndSession emit boundary markers

2. Refactor Existing Loggers
HierarchicalLogger → JSONL
Replace your LogSession, LogSequenceStep, LogProjectEvent methods with calls to MemStore.LogEvent:

powershell

Copy
class HierarchicalLogger {
    [void]LogSession([string]$command, [string]$output) {
        $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
            "command",
            @{ command = $command; output = $output },
            @{ context = "session" }
        )
    }

    [void]LogSequenceStep([string]$seq, [string]$step, [hashtable]$result) {
        $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
            "sequence_step",
            @{ sequence = $seq; step = $step; result = $result },
            @{ context = "sequence" }
        )
    }

    [void]LogProjectEvent([string]$event, [hashtable]$meta) {
        $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
            "project_event",
            @{ name = $event; metadata = $meta },
            @{ context = "project" }
        )
    }
}
Remove file-based JSONL writes and let the store handle it

Maintain context flags so you can later filter

Capture Hooks Integration
In your console-capture functions, swap the out-file logic:

powershell

Copy
function Start-AdvancedConsoleCapture {
    param($Command, $EnableMemoryIntegration)

    $out = & $Command 2>&1 | Out-String
    if ($EnableMemoryIntegration) {
        $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
            "command_capture",
            @{ command = $Command; output = $out },
            @{ hook = "console"; context = "capture" }
        )
    }
    return $out
}
3. Session Boundary Detection
Keep your SessionBoundaryLogging.ps1 hooks but redirect to JSONL:

powershell

Copy
function Start-SessionBoundaryLogging {
    # On VSCode launch
    Register-WmiEvent -Query "..." -Action {
        $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
            "session_boundary",
            @{ trigger="vscode_launch" },
            @{ status="start" }
        )
    }

    # On PowerShell exit
    Register-EngineEvent PowerShell.Exiting -Action {
        $global:MemStore.EndSession()
    }
}
4. Querying & Augmentation
Your context-synthesis engine can now scan a single file:

powershell

Copy
function Get-RecentEvents([int]$minutes) {
    Get-Content $global:MemStore.Path |
      ConvertFrom-Json |
      Where-Object { 
          [DateTime]$_.timestamp -gt (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-$minutes) 
      }
}
Feed those entries into embeddings or direct prompt injections.

5. Next Steps
Indexing Layer: Build an in-memory index of last N events for fast queries.

JSON Schema: Define a JSON Schema or Protobuf to validate each line.

Pruning: Add retention policies—e.g. drop global events older than 90 days.

REST/gRPC Feed: Expose a service endpoint so your augmentation layer can tail live events.

Visualization: Hook D3/Graphviz to render session timelines from your JSONL.

By consolidating all your modules into one append-only JSONL sink, you gain a single source of truth, simplified context retrieval, and pluggable downstream analytics—all while preserving your hierarchical, session-aware machinery.

ill probably move stuff to a cold storage archive after whatever number of days. The console capture i hadn't thought about artifacting since its really only useful in the moment
Copilot said
Tiered Retention and Ephemeral Console Capture Strategies
You can treat your JSONL store as a “hot” zone for the last N days and move older entries to “cold” archive files, while treating console captures as truly ephemeral (in-memory or truncated) so you don’t bloat your primary store.

1. Hot vs. Cold Storage
Hot Store
• Contains JSONL events ≤ N days old
• Backed by your live agent_memory.jsonl  
• Fast reads for real-time augmentation

Cold Archive
• JSONL files partitioned by month or week (e.g. archive/2025-06.jsonl)
• Compressed (gzip) or moved to blob storage after archiving
• Auditable, append-only, offline

2. JSONL Archiver Module
Create a scheduled archiver that runs daily:

powershell

Copy
function Invoke-JsonlArchiver {
    param(
        [string]$HotPath       = "$env:PORTABLE_HOME\agent_memory.jsonl",
        [string]$ArchiveDir    = "$env:PORTABLE_HOME\archive",
        [int]$DaysToKeep       = 7
    )

    # Ensure archive directory exists
    if (-not (Test-Path $ArchiveDir)) {
        New-Item -Path $ArchiveDir -ItemType Directory | Out-Null
    }

    # Prepare archive file for this month
    $monthFile = Join-Path $ArchiveDir "$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM').jsonl"

    # Read & partition
    $cutoff = (Get-Date).AddDays(-$DaysToKeep)
    $keepLines = New-Object System.Collections.Generic.List[string]
    
    Get-Content $HotPath | ForEach-Object {
        try {
            $obj = $_ | ConvertFrom-Json
            $ts  = [DateTime]$obj.timestamp
            if ($ts -lt $cutoff) {
                # Move to archive
                Add-Content -Path $monthFile -Value $_
            } else {
                $keepLines.Add($_)
            }
        } catch { 
            # malformed line — keep it to avoid data loss
            $keepLines.Add($_) 
        }
    }

    # Rewrite hot store with only recent entries
    $keepLines | Set-Content -Path $HotPath
}

# Schedule daily archiving (PowerShell Task Scheduler)
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "JsonlArchiver" `
    -Trigger (New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At "03:00") `
    -Action (New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "powershell" `
        -Argument "-NoProfile -Command Invoke-JsonlArchiver") `
    -RunLevel Highest -Force
Scans each line’s timestamp

Moves old lines to a month-based archive JSONL

Rewrites the hot store in place

3. Partitioned Hot Store for Faster Scans
If your hot JSONL grows large, split it by day:


Copy
agent_memory-2025-08-10.jsonl
agent_memory-2025-08-11.jsonl
…
current.jsonl → symlink or latest
When archiving, simply delete whole date files older than N days

current.jsonl always points at today’s file

This eliminates line-by-line filtering.

4. Ephemeral Console Capture
Rather than writing full console output to persistent JSONL:

In-Memory Ring Buffer: Keep only the last M commands+outputs in a global list

Truncated Payloads: Only log first/last X lines or a checksum of the output

On-Demand Dump: When you hit an error, send the recent buffer as a single “error_dump” event

Example ring buffer:

powershell

Copy
# At startup
$global:ConsoleBuffer = [System.Collections.Generic.Queue[hashtable]]::new()
$global:ConsoleBufferMax = 20

function Capture-EphemeralConsole {
    param($Command, $Output)
    $entry = @{
        timestamp = (Get-Date).ToString("o")
        command   = $Command
        summary   = $Output.Split("`n")[0..4] -join "`n"  # first 5 lines
    }
    # Enqueue & trim
    $global:ConsoleBuffer.Enqueue($entry)
    while ($global:ConsoleBuffer.Count -gt $global:ConsoleBufferMax) {
        $null = $global:ConsoleBuffer.Dequeue()
    }
}

# On real-time events, if something critical happens:
function Dump-ConsoleBuffer {
    $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
        "error_dump",
        @{ buffer = $global:ConsoleBuffer.ToArray() },
        @{ context="ephemeral"; trigger="on_error" }
    )
}
Daily resets keep this entirely in-memory

Only “real” errors or manual dumps ever touch the JSONL

5. Next-Level Enhancements
Add gzip compression for archive files (Compress-Archive or GzipStream)

Store archives in cloud buckets (Azure Blob, AWS S3) via CLI/SDK

Build a CLI query tool to pull events by date, type, or session

Integrate a dashboard (Grafana, D3) that reads both hot and cold JSONL

By splitting hot vs. cold, partitioning, and making console captures truly ephemeral, you’ll keep your primary JSONL agile for augmentation and limit your storage footprint over time.

well part of the utility of the memory system is the temporal and session continuity of context, such as over the course of days of development as well as perhaps across team members someday
Copilot said
Extending Memory for Multi-Day and Multi-User Continuity
You can evolve your JSONL-based memory pipeline into a structured, metadata-driven store that preserves session threads across days and even across team members. The key is layering your memory, enriching each event with session/user context, and leveraging retrieval for seamless continuity.

1. Metadata Schema for Temporal & Session Context
Every event you log should carry a consistent set of metadata fields:

timestamp

sessionId (UUID per work session)

userId (team member identifier)

project (repo or feature name)

tags (e.g. “bugfix,” “design,” “api-ingestion”)

cursor or sequence (monotonic index within a session)

Example JSONL event:

json

Copy
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T15:32:10.123Z",
  "sessionId": "5f1d7c88-3a4e-4fa8-9f00-abc123def456",
  "userId": "azriel",
  "project": "doc-miner",
  "tags": ["tokenization", "validation-layer"],
  "sequence": 42,
  "payload": {
    "type": "code_snippet",
    "content": "function Invoke-JsonlArchiver { … }"
  }
}
2. Layered Memory Stores
Short-Term (Hot) Store

One file per session (e.g. session-<id>.jsonl)

Fast append/read, scoped to current session

Medium-Term (Project) Store

Partitioned by week or month per project

Retains cross-session continuity for active features

Long-Term (Global/Team) Store

Consolidates all projects and users

Backed by a vector database or indexed JSONL for retrieval

This layering lets you trim or archive older session files while still enabling lookups by project or user over longer horizons.

3. Retrieval-Augmented Continuity
When starting a new session or switching users, pull the most relevant past events to rehydrate context:

Query by Session or Project

Filter medium-term files for this project, sorted by timestamp.

Semantic Embedding Search

Encode payloads into embeddings.

Retrieve top-K semantically similar events across all users/projects.

Context Window Assembly

Merge the last N events from the previous session + any high-relevance hits.

Inject them into your agent’s prompt or memory buffer.

This guarantees your assistant “remembers” past architecture decisions, code patterns, or ongoing tickets.

4. Code Snippet: Tagging and Retrieval
PowerShell for logging:

powershell

Copy
function Log-Event {
    param(
        [hashtable]$payload,
        [string]$type,
        [string]$sessionId,
        [string]$userId,
        [string]$project
    )
    $entry = @{
        timestamp = (Get-Date).ToUniversalTime().ToString("o")
        sessionId = $sessionId
        userId    = $userId
        project   = $project
        tags      = @($type)
        sequence  = ([guid]::NewGuid().ToString())  # or an int counter
        payload   = $payload
    }
    $file = Join-Path $env:MEM_HOME "session-$sessionId.jsonl"
    $entry | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5 | Out-File -FilePath $file -Append
}
Python pseudo-code for vector retrieval:

python

Copy
# Load events with metadata from project archive
events = load_jsonl("archive/doc-miner-2025-08.jsonl")

# Build or load embeddings
embeddings = [embed(ev["payload"]["content"]) for ev in events]

# Query helper
def retrieve_context(query_text, top_k=5):
    q_emb = embed(query_text)
    scores = cosine_sim(q_emb, embeddings)
    hits = sorted(zip(scores, events), reverse=True)[:top_k]
    return [h[1] for h in hits]
5. Orchestrating Across Team Members
Shared Registry: Keep a central JSON or database that maps sessionId → userId, project, startTime, endTime.

Access Control: Use file-system or bucket ACLs so only authorized team members read/write.

Dashboard: Build a Grafana or D3 interface that shows session timelines, user activity heatmaps, and tag breakdowns.

Notifications: On session switch, push a “welcome back” summary of prior decisions or open tasks.

6. Next Steps & Divergent Ideas
Introduce a Memory Graph: Nodes are events, edges link by sequence, tag, or semantic similarity.

Automate Decision Harvesting: Periodically scan for “design_comment” tags and draft a changelog or technical spec.

Leverage Temporal Layers: Use time-decayed embedding stores so distant context increments less weight unless explicitly referenced.

Explore Fine-Grained ACLs: Allow team members to mark events as private or public within the shared memory.

How would you like to refine the retrieval logic or session management? Any preferences on embedding technology or dashboarding?

Copilot said
JSONL Memory Augmentation Architecture
Building a single source of truth for your coding agent’s memory involves treating each interaction, event, and context update as a structured JSON record. By streaming these records into a newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) store, you gain append-only auditability, hierarchical logging, and pluggable session helpers without scattering data across files and folders.

Core Concepts
Each log entry is an atomic JSON object with a consistent schema

Entries are appended in real time into a single JSONL file or stream

Session boundaries, hierarchical context, and metadata pointers live inside each entry

A lightweight index or in-memory buffer can speed up reads by session, by project, or globally

Define a unified JSON schema that covers all your capture, memory, and augmentation layers:

json

Hierarchical Logging Integration
Wire your existing hierarchical logger so each log call translates into a JSONL line:

Wrap or extend your logger (PowerShell, .NET, Python) to serialize structured events

Tag each log entry with hierarchy.project_id, hierarchy.sequence and parent pointers

Append directly to the JSONL sink (file, STDOUT, or a streaming endpoint)

Consolidating Hierarchical Logs into a JSONL Memory Store
You’ve built an impressive set of PowerShell modules for capture, supervision, templating, etc. The next step is to route all of those multi-scope events into a single newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) sink. This gives you:

One append-only, audit-friendly source of truth

Unified schema for session, sequence, project, global events

Easy ingestion by your augmentation layer or vector index

1. JSONL Memory Store Module
Create a new file Core/JsonlMemoryStore.ps1 with a class to drive all logging:

powershell

Copy
class JsonlMemoryStore {
    [string]$Path
    [string]$SessionId
    [int]$Sequence

    JsonlMemoryStore([string]$path) {
        $this.Path       = $path
        $this.SessionId  = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString()
        $this.Sequence   = 0
    }

    [void]LogEvent(
        [string]$EventType,
        [hashtable]$Payload,
        [hashtable]$Helpers
    ) {
        $entry = @{
            timestamp   = (Get-Date).ToString("o")
            session_id  = $this.SessionId
            sequence    = $this.Sequence
            event_type  = $EventType
            payload     = $Payload
            helpers     = $Helpers
        } | ConvertTo-Json -Compress

        Add-Content -Path $this.Path -Value $entry
        $this.Sequence++
    }

    [void]StartSession() {
        $this.LogEvent(
            "session_boundary",
            @{ status = "start" },
            @{ idle_timeout = 900 }
        )
    }

    [void]EndSession() {
        $this.LogEvent(
            "session_boundary",
            @{ status = "end" },
            @{}
        )
    }
}

# Initialize global store
$global:MemStore = [JsonlMemoryStore]::new("$env:PORTABLE_HOME\agent_memory.jsonl")
$global:MemStore.StartSession()
LogEvent appends a single JSON object per line

StartSession/EndSession emit boundary markers

2. Refactor Existing Loggers
HierarchicalLogger → JSONL
Replace your LogSession, LogSequenceStep, LogProjectEvent methods with calls to MemStore.LogEvent:

powershell

Copy
class HierarchicalLogger {
    [void]LogSession([string]$command, [string]$output) {
        $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
            "command",
            @{ command = $command; output = $output },
            @{ context = "session" }
        )
    }

    [void]LogSequenceStep([string]$seq, [string]$step, [hashtable]$result) {
        $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
            "sequence_step",
            @{ sequence = $seq; step = $step; result = $result },
            @{ context = "sequence" }
        )
    }

    [void]LogProjectEvent([string]$event, [hashtable]$meta) {
        $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
            "project_event",
            @{ name = $event; metadata = $meta },
            @{ context = "project" }
        )
    }
}
Remove file-based JSONL writes and let the store handle it

Maintain context flags so you can later filter

Capture Hooks Integration
In your console-capture functions, swap the out-file logic:

powershell

Copy
function Start-AdvancedConsoleCapture {
    param($Command, $EnableMemoryIntegration)

    $out = & $Command 2>&1 | Out-String
    if ($EnableMemoryIntegration) {
        $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
            "command_capture",
            @{ command = $Command; output = $out },
            @{ hook = "console"; context = "capture" }
        )
    }
    return $out
}
3. Session Boundary Detection
Keep your SessionBoundaryLogging.ps1 hooks but redirect to JSONL:

powershell

Copy
function Start-SessionBoundaryLogging {
    # On VSCode launch
    Register-WmiEvent -Query "..." -Action {
        $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
            "session_boundary",
            @{ trigger="vscode_launch" },
            @{ status="start" }
        )
    }

    # On PowerShell exit
    Register-EngineEvent PowerShell.Exiting -Action {
        $global:MemStore.EndSession()
    }
}
4. Querying & Augmentation
Your context-synthesis engine can now scan a single file:

powershell

Copy
function Get-RecentEvents([int]$minutes) {
    Get-Content $global:MemStore.Path |
      ConvertFrom-Json |
      Where-Object { 
          [DateTime]$_.timestamp -gt (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-$minutes) 
      }
}
Feed those entries into embeddings or direct prompt injections.

5. Next Steps
Indexing Layer: Build an in-memory index of last N events for fast queries.

JSON Schema: Define a JSON Schema or Protobuf to validate each line.

Pruning: Add retention policies—e.g. drop global events older than 90 days.

REST/gRPC Feed: Expose a service endpoint so your augmentation layer can tail live events.

Visualization: Hook D3/Graphviz to render session timelines from your JSONL.

By consolidating all your modules into one append-only JSONL sink, you gain a single source of truth, simplified context retrieval, and pluggable downstream analytics—all while preserving your hierarchical, session-aware machinery.

ill probably move stuff to a cold storage archive after whatever number of days. The console capture i hadn't thought about artifacting since its really only useful in the moment
Copilot said
Tiered Retention and Ephemeral Console Capture Strategies
You can treat your JSONL store as a “hot” zone for the last N days and move older entries to “cold” archive files, while treating console captures as truly ephemeral (in-memory or truncated) so you don’t bloat your primary store.

1. Hot vs. Cold Storage
Hot Store
• Contains JSONL events ≤ N days old
• Backed by your live agent_memory.jsonl  
• Fast reads for real-time augmentation

Cold Archive
• JSONL files partitioned by month or week (e.g. archive/2025-06.jsonl)
• Compressed (gzip) or moved to blob storage after archiving
• Auditable, append-only, offline

2. JSONL Archiver Module
Create a scheduled archiver that runs daily:

powershell

Copy
function Invoke-JsonlArchiver {
    param(
        [string]$HotPath       = "$env:PORTABLE_HOME\agent_memory.jsonl",
        [string]$ArchiveDir    = "$env:PORTABLE_HOME\archive",
        [int]$DaysToKeep       = 7
    )

    # Ensure archive directory exists
    if (-not (Test-Path $ArchiveDir)) {
        New-Item -Path $ArchiveDir -ItemType Directory | Out-Null
    }

    # Prepare archive file for this month
    $monthFile = Join-Path $ArchiveDir "$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM').jsonl"

    # Read & partition
    $cutoff = (Get-Date).AddDays(-$DaysToKeep)
    $keepLines = New-Object System.Collections.Generic.List[string]
    
    Get-Content $HotPath | ForEach-Object {
        try {
            $obj = $_ | ConvertFrom-Json
            $ts  = [DateTime]$obj.timestamp
            if ($ts -lt $cutoff) {
                # Move to archive
                Add-Content -Path $monthFile -Value $_
            } else {
                $keepLines.Add($_)
            }
        } catch { 
            # malformed line — keep it to avoid data loss
            $keepLines.Add($_) 
        }
    }

    # Rewrite hot store with only recent entries
    $keepLines | Set-Content -Path $HotPath
}

# Schedule daily archiving (PowerShell Task Scheduler)
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "JsonlArchiver" `
    -Trigger (New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At "03:00") `
    -Action (New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "powershell" `
        -Argument "-NoProfile -Command Invoke-JsonlArchiver") `
    -RunLevel Highest -Force
Scans each line’s timestamp

Moves old lines to a month-based archive JSONL

Rewrites the hot store in place

3. Partitioned Hot Store for Faster Scans
If your hot JSONL grows large, split it by day:


Copy
agent_memory-2025-08-10.jsonl
agent_memory-2025-08-11.jsonl
…
current.jsonl → symlink or latest
When archiving, simply delete whole date files older than N days

current.jsonl always points at today’s file

This eliminates line-by-line filtering.

4. Ephemeral Console Capture
Rather than writing full console output to persistent JSONL:

In-Memory Ring Buffer: Keep only the last M commands+outputs in a global list

Truncated Payloads: Only log first/last X lines or a checksum of the output

On-Demand Dump: When you hit an error, send the recent buffer as a single “error_dump” event

Example ring buffer:

powershell

Copy
# At startup
$global:ConsoleBuffer = [System.Collections.Generic.Queue[hashtable]]::new()
$global:ConsoleBufferMax = 20

function Capture-EphemeralConsole {
    param($Command, $Output)
    $entry = @{
        timestamp = (Get-Date).ToString("o")
        command   = $Command
        summary   = $Output.Split("`n")[0..4] -join "`n"  # first 5 lines
    }
    # Enqueue & trim
    $global:ConsoleBuffer.Enqueue($entry)
    while ($global:ConsoleBuffer.Count -gt $global:ConsoleBufferMax) {
        $null = $global:ConsoleBuffer.Dequeue()
    }
}

# On real-time events, if something critical happens:
function Dump-ConsoleBuffer {
    $global:MemStore.LogEvent(
        "error_dump",
        @{ buffer = $global:ConsoleBuffer.ToArray() },
        @{ context="ephemeral"; trigger="on_error" }
    )
}
Daily resets keep this entirely in-memory

Only “real” errors or manual dumps ever touch the JSONL

5. Next-Level Enhancements
Add gzip compression for archive files (Compress-Archive or GzipStream)

Store archives in cloud buckets (Azure Blob, AWS S3) via CLI/SDK

Build a CLI query tool to pull events by date, type, or session

Integrate a dashboard (Grafana, D3) that reads both hot and cold JSONL

By splitting hot vs. cold, partitioning, and making console captures truly ephemeral, you’ll keep your primary JSONL agile for augmentation and limit your storage footprint over time.

well part of the utility of the memory system is the temporal and session continuity of context, such as over the course of days of development as well as perhaps across team members someday
Copilot said
Extending Memory for Multi-Day and Multi-User Continuity
You can evolve your JSONL-based memory pipeline into a structured, metadata-driven store that preserves session threads across days and even across team members. The key is layering your memory, enriching each event with session/user context, and leveraging retrieval for seamless continuity.

1. Metadata Schema for Temporal & Session Context
Every event you log should carry a consistent set of metadata fields:

timestamp

sessionId (UUID per work session)

userId (team member identifier)

project (repo or feature name)

tags (e.g. “bugfix,” “design,” “api-ingestion”)

cursor or sequence (monotonic index within a session)

Example JSONL event:

json

Copy
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T15:32:10.123Z",
  "sessionId": "5f1d7c88-3a4e-4fa8-9f00-abc123def456",
  "userId": "azriel",
  "project": "doc-miner",
  "tags": ["tokenization", "validation-layer"],
  "sequence": 42,
  "payload": {
    "type": "code_snippet",
    "content": "function Invoke-JsonlArchiver { … }"
  }
}
2. Layered Memory Stores
Short-Term (Hot) Store

One file per session (e.g. session-<id>.jsonl)

Fast append/read, scoped to current session

Medium-Term (Project) Store

Partitioned by week or month per project

Retains cross-session continuity for active features

Long-Term (Global/Team) Store

Consolidates all projects and users

Backed by a vector database or indexed JSONL for retrieval

This layering lets you trim or archive older session files while still enabling lookups by project or user over longer horizons.

3. Retrieval-Augmented Continuity
When starting a new session or switching users, pull the most relevant past events to rehydrate context:

Query by Session or Project

Filter medium-term files for this project, sorted by timestamp.

Semantic Embedding Search

Encode payloads into embeddings.

Retrieve top-K semantically similar events across all users/projects.

Context Window Assembly

Merge the last N events from the previous session + any high-relevance hits.

Inject them into your agent’s prompt or memory buffer.

This guarantees your assistant “remembers” past architecture decisions, code patterns, or ongoing tickets.

4. Code Snippet: Tagging and Retrieval
PowerShell for logging:

powershell

Copy
function Log-Event {
    param(
        [hashtable]$payload,
        [string]$type,
        [string]$sessionId,
        [string]$userId,
        [string]$project
    )
    $entry = @{
        timestamp = (Get-Date).ToUniversalTime().ToString("o")
        sessionId = $sessionId
        userId    = $userId
        project   = $project
        tags      = @($type)
        sequence  = ([guid]::NewGuid().ToString())  # or an int counter
        payload   = $payload
    }
    $file = Join-Path $env:MEM_HOME "session-$sessionId.jsonl"
    $entry | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5 | Out-File -FilePath $file -Append
}
Python pseudo-code for vector retrieval:

python

Copy
# Load events with metadata from project archive
events = load_jsonl("archive/doc-miner-2025-08.jsonl")

# Build or load embeddings
embeddings = [embed(ev["payload"]["content"]) for ev in events]

# Query helper
def retrieve_context(query_text, top_k=5):
    q_emb = embed(query_text)
    scores = cosine_sim(q_emb, embeddings)
    hits = sorted(zip(scores, events), reverse=True)[:top_k]
    return [h[1] for h in hits]
5. Orchestrating Across Team Members
Shared Registry: Keep a central JSON or database that maps sessionId → userId, project, startTime, endTime.

Access Control: Use file-system or bucket ACLs so only authorized team members read/write.

Dashboard: Build a Grafana or D3 interface that shows session timelines, user activity heatmaps, and tag breakdowns.

Notifications: On session switch, push a “welcome back” summary of prior decisions or open tasks.

6. Next Steps & Divergent Ideas
Introduce a Memory Graph: Nodes are events, edges link by sequence, tag, or semantic similarity.

Automate Decision Harvesting: Periodically scan for “design_comment” tags and draft a changelog or technical spec.

Leverage Temporal Layers: Use time-decayed embedding stores so distant context increments less weight unless explicitly referenced.

Explore Fine-Grained ACLs: Allow team members to mark events as private or public within the shared memory.

How would you like to refine the retrieval logic or session management? Any preferences on embedding technology or dashboarding?


well please re-render all of it in full with these fixes and with linting etc, also note what i noted earlier, that i want to keep logging folders flattened and use filename conventions to carry information of the folder structure. e.g.  instead of .copilot/logs/sessions and .copilot/logs/sequences, i want output files to be copilot-logs-session-{timestamp}.{filetype}. There's scoping and context to consider e.g. workspace-level logging and work, global logging that may occur outside of the scope of the workspace, etc
